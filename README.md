# DeepWaterWaveMotion
The trajectories of the Deep-Water Wave Motion are shown in Matlab code.

# Physical Parameter Descriptions
1. Wave Length = 100.0 meters
2. Wave Period = 10.0 seconds
3. Wave Amplitude = 0.5 meters

# Code Descriptions
1. DeepWaterWaveMotion_NoStokesDrift.m -> Deep-Water wave's motion without the Stokes Drift.
2. DeepWaterWaveMotion_WithStokesDrift.m -> Deep-Water wave's motion with the Stokes Drift.
3. DeepWaterWaveMotion_WithStokesDrift_Large.m -> Deep-Water wave's motion with the Stokes Drift and be shown in the larger domain.
