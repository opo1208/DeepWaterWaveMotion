Wave Period = 10.0 seconds
Wave Amplitude = 0.5 meters

# Code Descriptions
1. DeepWaterWaveMotion_NoStokesDrift.m -> Deep-Water wave's motion without the Stokes Drift.
2. DeepWaterWaveMotion_WithStokesDrift.m -> Deep-Water wave's motion with the Stokes Drift.
3. DeepWaterWaveMotion_WithStokesDrift_Large.m -> Deep-Water wave's motion with the Stokes Drift and be shown in the larger domain.
